#What is marfframework?

Marfframework is a javascript libary containing some jquery stuff, Fullscreen API, Push Api, Smooth Scrolling, Cookies, add text to a ID, Set text, Clear it, remove it.


I've made this libaray for my self. but you can use is and even edit it. Feel free to fork.

This wil be used for my websites, and school projects.


#Getting Started
I suggest you to look to the libary it self, if i have the time i'll write a wiki page for the framework.
Everything is documented in the .js file.

To use my framework you can add this in your webpage. this prehosted version updates with the Latest Releases of this project.
